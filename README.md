# Annotorious Magnetic Oultine Plugin

A polygon drawing tool for Annotorious that supports snapping of corner points 
to the outlines of objects in the image.

> **Important:** this plugin only supports `@annotorious/openseadragon` at this time. Support for 
> plain (JPEG, PNG,...) images is not yet implemented. [Get in touch via the forum](https://github.com/orgs/annotorious/discussions) if you are interested in using this with the `@annotorious/annotorious` or `@annotorious/react` packages.
